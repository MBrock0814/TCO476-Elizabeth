Select one of your projects from the previous assignment and develop a documentation plan for it. (Note the additional steps added in yellow below)
Include an outline for each of the 5 topics that make up the Minimum Viable Assignment:
Home page
Procedure page
Reference page
Related information page
Error handling page
For each page, include:
An outline of the content
A description of any media assets
Any other information that will help you write the topic.
What you assume the readers' goal(s) are when they use this page and how their success could be measured.
What "extra value" you could add to the topic to make it more helpful. Depending on the topic, this could be:
Illustrations (diagrams, photos, drawings, and such)
Videos
Audio narration
???
The format for this assignment is not critical. Having the required content is.
Pro tips:
If you do this in markdown, you'll have content that can be later fleshed out into full topics for the final assignment.
Review the presentation requirements to plan ahead (while this is fresh in your mind!)
Submit any one of the following (they are all worth the same points)
a) If you built the site with outlined topics: A link to your published pages
b) If you authored in markdown but have not built a site: upload each page individually (so you'll upload 5 markdown pages)
c) If you just wrote this information out as text or a word file, upload the file.


How to make a WordPress Blog
I changed the idea, mainly because I didn’t do that great of a job on the last assignment. This seems easier to follow through on. 
Go to WordPress and click the Sign-Up button.
You will need to put in a valid email that you can login to, and make a URL that you want for your blog to have. In general, follow the directions that WordPress gives you.
I will include some of the themes that have been proven to be the most user friendly to put together and the themes that are the most user friendly to navigate. I will link to articles on how to write effective blog articles that people read through to the end. The trouble-shooting portion of the documentation area will include how to insert google analytics, and how to code your own WordPress Theme. 
The Home Page
This page will give a link to the WordPress Login, and then describe what they need to do if:
They haven’t made an account
They haven’t made a blog
They forgot their account information
Otherwise follow the directions that WordPress gives to construct everything effectively. Make sure to use a valid email address that you can reach later. 

The Procedure Page
This page describes the importance of having a specialty blog that readers can rely on when reading the blog. Some blogs talk about everything that comes to their mind, but it is important to have keywords that Google can work off of to place your blog in their search results.
This page gives some pointers on how to make an effective blog article. How to write the perfect headline, how many pictures should be included, and how many words should each article average.  

 Reference Page
This page goes over how to input Google Analytics, how to make adwords, how to hashtag, and how to use any built-in analytics that WordPress has to offer.
There may be some interest on how to code a WordPress Theme, so that will be covered here too. Troubleshooting may be extensive, so that could get its own Link Hierarchy if needed.

Error Handling Page
Error: I made a blog, and I hate all my blog posts, how do I delete them?
Error: I made a blog, and I want it to just post for me without me having to do a ton of work every day. What do I do?
Google Analytics isn’t working, what do I do?
How to I use enough adwords to actually be prevalent on Google?
How do I put ads that pay me money on my page?
None of these questions answer any of my questions.
