How to make a WordPress Blog
----
I changed the idea, mainly because I didn’t do that great of a job on the last assignment. This seems easier to follow through on. 
Go to WordPress and click the Sign-Up button.
You will need to put in a valid email that you can login to, and make a URL that you want for your blog to have. In general, follow the directions that WordPress gives you.
I will include some of the themes that have been proven to be the most user friendly to put together and the themes that are the most user friendly to navigate. I will link to articles on how to write effective blog articles that people read through to the end. The trouble-shooting portion of the documentation area will include how to insert google analytics, and how to code your own WordPress Theme. 

The Home Page
-------------

	This page will give a link to the WordPress Login, and then describe what they need to do if:
		

 - They haven’t made an account 
 - They forgot their account information 		
 - Otherwise follow the directions that WordPres gives to construct everything effectively. 
 - They haven't made their blog
 - Make sure to use to use a valid email address that you can reach later.

The Procedure Page
-------------
This page describes the importance of having a specialty blog that readers can rely on when reading the blog. Some blogs talk about everything that comes to their mind, but it is important to have keywords that Google can work off of to place your blog in their search results.
This page gives some pointers on how to make an effective blog article. How to write the perfect headline, how many pictures should be included, and how many words should each article average.  

 Reference Page
-------------
This page goes over how to input Google Analytics, how to make adwords, how to hashtag, and how to use any built-in analytics that WordPress has to offer.
There may be some interest on how to code a WordPress Theme, so that will be covered here too. Troubleshooting may be extensive, so that could get its own Link Hierarchy if needed.
